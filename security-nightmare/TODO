* SQL injection
    userid in user delete is unescaped - assert allows code to pass through in models/user.php:delete
* Blind SQL injection
* XSS
    Username echoed unescaped in input in login form views/session/create.php
* Remote file inclusion
* Constant forgot password link
* Unsalted md5 for password hashing
    models/user.php does not use proper hashing for password storage - md5 is insecure and it's unsalted
* Shell injection
* Forgot password token empty on register
* Forgot password token empty after forgot password
* Unauthenticated page to delete user account
    controllers/user.php:delete does not authenticate
* CSRF
    No CSRF protection at all
* GET without POST
    index.php allows POST methods to be called via GET
* Can login without password!
    header() does not stop execution, so code passses through in controllers/session.php:create
    allowing anyone to login with a correct username and any password
* Open redirect
